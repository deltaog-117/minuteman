## 📝 Decision Entries

### Workspace Architecture: Feature-First Cargo Workspace

**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Status:** Confirmed

#### Context / Background

Minuteman needed an initial crate/module layout before any feature code could be written.
`$SUITE/1architecture.md` mandates feature-first organization (top-level dirs named after
business capabilities, not technical layers) and a "delete test" — each feature folder must be
removable without breaking the rest of the app, with zero circular dependencies between
features.

#### Options Considered

**Option A: Single binary crate, modules by layer** (e.g. `ui/`, `fs/`, `config/`)
- Fastest to start, but violates the delete-test and layer-first rules directly; also forces one
  compile unit for the whole app, so iterating on the browser recompiles the (eventual) plugin
  host too.

**Option B: Single binary crate, modules by feature** (e.g. `browser/`, `file_ops/` as `mod`s)
- Satisfies feature-first within one crate, but Rust's visibility rules make cross-feature
  leakage easy to introduce accidentally (no hard compiler boundary), and it doesn't let heavy,
  optional dependencies (SSH, WASM plugin host) be excluded from a minimal build.

**Option C: Cargo workspace, one crate per feature** *(chosen)*
- Each feature is its own crate depending only on `shared`; Cargo itself enforces the "no
  feature depends on another feature" rule at compile time (a stray `browser -> file_ops`
  dependency simply won't compile without explicitly adding it to `Cargo.toml`, which is a
  visible, reviewable change). Optional heavy backends (`vfs_ssh`) can be dropped from the
  workspace member list without touching any other crate — a literal, mechanical delete test.

#### Decision & Rationale

Chose the Cargo workspace split: `shared` (Vfs trait + local impl, read-only infra),
`vfs_ssh`, `browser`, `file_ops`, `preview`, `shell_overlay`, `trash`, `plugins`, `theming`
(each an independent feature crate depending only on `shared`), and `tui` as the thin binary
that wires everything together via dependency injection in `main.rs`.

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- More `Cargo.toml` boilerplate than a single crate.
- Slightly slower clean-build time due to crate-boundary codegen, offset by much faster
  incremental rebuilds once more than one feature exists (changing `browser` doesn't recompile
  `plugins`).

#### Implementation Notes
- `plugins` is deliberately isolated from other feature crates (only depends on `shared`) so
  that internal refactors of `browser`/`file_ops` never force a plugin-facing API break — this
  directly serves the "stable, semver'd plugin API" differentiator from `ROADMAP.md`.
- `tui/src/main.rs` stays thin: arg parsing, config load, `Vfs`/`BrowserState` construction,
  terminal setup — no business logic.

### Config Keybinding Schema: Action-to-Keys Mapping

**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Status:** Confirmed

#### Context / Background

The user wanted config loading in place from v0.1.0 rather than hardcoded keys retrofitted
later, and asked which TOML shape to use: one key mapping to one action, or one action mapping
to a list of keys.

#### Options Considered

**Option A: key → action** (`j = "move_down"`) — simplest, but one key can only ever mean one
thing, and multi-key/leader sequences (planned for the space-leader system) don't fit the shape.

**Option B: action → [keys]** (`move_down = ["j"]`) *(chosen)* — one action can have multiple
bound keys, and the shape extends naturally to future leader sequences without a schema change.

#### Decision & Rationale

Chose B. Implemented as `RawKeyMap` (serde-deserialized, `#[serde(default)]` at both the
container and field level via a custom `Default` impl, so a partial `[keys]` table only
overrides the fields it specifies) converted into a `KeyMap` that resolves a crossterm
`KeyCode` to an `Action` via a `HashMap`. `theming` depends directly on `crossterm::event::KeyCode`
rather than inventing a separate key-representation enum — crossterm is already a hard
dependency of the application, and there's no second input backend on the roadmap that would
justify the extra abstraction layer yet.

**Trade-offs accepted:** if two keys in the config resolve to the same `KeyCode`, last-write-in
wins silently (no conflict warning) — acceptable for v0.1.0's small default keymap; worth
revisiting once user-configurable rebinding sees real use.

### v0.1.0 Local Vfs: Synchronous, No Async Runtime Yet

**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Status:** Confirmed

#### Context / Background

The project's core motivation is fixing Ranger's slow bulk file operations, which implies an
async runtime (`tokio`) somewhere. The question was whether to introduce it starting with v0.1.0
(directory listing) or defer it.

#### Decision & Rationale

Deferred. A single `read_dir` call for a miller-column pane is not a workload that benefits from
async, and pulling in `tokio` before there's an actual concurrent/long-running operation to
schedule would be unused complexity. `tokio` will be introduced when `file_ops` implements bulk
copy/move/delete with live progress reporting — the point where it earns its place.

---

### Core File Operations: Extend `Vfs` Trait with Mutating Methods

**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Status:** Confirmed

#### Context / Background

`file_ops` needed copy/move/delete/create/rename. The `Vfs` trait was read-only
(`list_dir`/`is_dir`), so the question was where the mutating operations should live relative to
it.

#### Options Considered

**Option A: Extend `Vfs` itself** with mutating methods (`copy_file`, `create_dir`,
`create_file`, `rename`, `remove_file`, `remove_dir_all`, `exists`), implemented for `LocalVfs`;
`file_ops` becomes thin orchestration on top *(chosen)* — one trait boundary, pulls the
already-planned "VFS abstraction hardening" roadmap item forward, keeps `file_ops`
backend-agnostic so it works over `vfs_ssh` once that lands with no changes.

**Option B: Bypass the trait**, have `file_ops` call `std::fs` directly — fastest short-term, but
directly contradicts the project's stated goal and repeats the exact per-backend duplication
problem the workspace-architecture decision already solved for reads.

**Option C: A separate `VfsOps: Vfs` trait**, keeping `Vfs` read-only-only — mirrors `Read`/
`Write`, but doubles the trait every future backend must implement for a safety benefit that
doesn't apply here (nothing constructs a `Vfs` trait object and hands it to untrusted code).

#### Decision & Rationale

Chose A. `file_ops::{copy, mv, delete, create_directory, create_new_file, rename}` all take
`&dyn Vfs` and call only trait methods — no direct `std::fs` in `file_ops` itself.

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- `copy_file` and `rename` in `LocalVfs` manually check `dst.exists()` before calling
  `std::fs::copy`/`std::fs::rename`, since both silently overwrite/replace an existing
  destination. This has a narrow TOCTOU window (another process could create `dst` between the
  check and the actual syscall); acceptable for a single-user desktop file manager, and no worse
  than Ranger/nnn's own behavior. Revisit with `renameat2(..., RENAME_NOREPLACE)` (via a new
  `libc`/`rustix` dependency) if this ever needs to be race-free.
- `mv` has no cross-filesystem fallback yet — a rename across devices just returns the
  underlying io error. Deferred to the async bulk-ops cycle, where a copy+delete fallback
  naturally needs the same progress-reporting plumbing being built for that feature anyway.
- "View" (from the roadmap's "view, copy, move, delete, create, rename" wording) was treated as
  out of scope for `file_ops` — reading file contents for display is `preview`'s job, not a
  mutating filesystem operation.

---

### Conflict Resolution UX: `ConflictPolicy` Enum in `file_ops`, Not `Vfs`

**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Status:** Confirmed

#### Context / Background

Wiring `file_ops` into the TUI needed an overwrite/skip/abort prompt for paste and rename
conflicts, but `copy`/`mv`/`rename` always errored on an existing destination (a deliberate
hardening decision from the previous cycle). See the "Core File Operations" entry above for the
three options considered (extend `file_ops` signatures vs. push overwrite into `Vfs` vs. handle
it ad hoc in the TUI).

#### Decision & Rationale

Chose to add `file_ops::ConflictPolicy` (`Abort`/`Skip`/`Overwrite`) and `file_ops::Outcome`
(`Completed`/`Skipped`), threaded through `copy`/`mv`/`rename`. `Overwrite` is implemented by
deleting the existing destination (via the existing `delete()`) and retrying the same operation,
triggered off the real `VfsError::AlreadyExists` the underlying filesystem call already reports —
no separate `exists()` pre-check, so no new TOCTOU window beyond the one already accepted for
`copy_file`/`rename` in `LocalVfs`. `Vfs` itself did not change.

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- `Skip` and `Abort` behave identically in the current TUI (both leave everything untouched and
  report a status message) because `BrowserState` only supports a single selection — there is no
  batch of remaining files for `Skip` to continue past. The distinction exists in `file_ops` for
  when multi-select/batch paste lands (see ROADMAP's low-priority "Multi-tab / multi-pane
  workspaces" and any future batch-copy work), so that feature won't need another `file_ops`
  signature change.
- The TUI's `app::App` holds clipboard + prompt state as its own module (`tui/src/app.rs`)
  rather than in `browser::BrowserState`, since `browser` is scoped to navigation only (per the
  Workspace Architecture entry above) and clipboard/prompt state is UI-interaction state, not
  navigation state. `main.rs` stays a thin `Action -> App method` dispatcher.
- Verified against the compiled binary (not just unit tests) using two scripted PTY sessions
  driving real key sequences and asserting on actual filesystem end-state, since `cargo test`
  alone can't exercise the terminal event loop, prompt-mode key capture, or the conflict prompt.

### Async Bulk Ops Concurrency: `spawn_blocking` + Poll Loop, Not a Full Async Rewrite

**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Status:** Confirmed

#### Context / Background

The project's core motivation — fixing Ranger's slow bulk file operations — meant the whole TUI
needed to stop being purely synchronous. Everything up to this point (`Vfs`, `file_ops`, the
`browser`/`tui` event loop) was blocking `std::fs` on the main thread. Three approaches were
considered (see the "Which concurrency architecture" question resolved with the user this
cycle):

**Option A: `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` + a non-blocking poll loop** *(chosen)* — one
`tokio::runtime::Runtime` constructed in `main`, its `Handle` stored on `tui::app::App`. A bulk
op spawns the existing synchronous `file_ops` walk (now progress-callback-aware) onto tokio's
blocking thread pool; progress flows back over `tokio::sync::mpsc`. `run()`'s loop switched from
a blocking `crossterm::event::read()` to `event::poll(Duration::from_millis(100))`, so it drains
the channel and redraws even with no keypress — this is ratatui's own documented pattern for
background tasks.

**Option B: a fully async event loop** (`#[tokio::main]`, `crossterm::event::EventStream` +
`tokio::select!` for everything) — the "textbook" async TUI architecture, but a full rewrite of
the already-working, already-tested event loop for a payoff (easier future async I/O for
`vfs_ssh`) nothing needs yet.

**Option C: raw `std::thread::spawn` + `std::sync::mpsc`, no tokio at all** — simplest, zero new
dependencies, and sufficient for "one background thread + a channel" since there's no actual
async I/O multiplexing happening (`std::fs` is blocking either way). Rejected because it
contradicts `ROADMAP.md`'s explicit "tokio + a thread pool" wording (written into the plan
before this cycle) and defers the tokio adoption `vfs_ssh`'s real async network I/O will need
eventually — introducing it twice instead of once.

#### Decision & Rationale

Chose A. `spawn_blocking` is the textbook-correct tool for wrapping blocking `std::fs` work
inside a tokio context, and it keeps the blast radius contained: `Vfs`, `browser`, and every
single-item synchronous path (rename, create) are untouched. `file_ops` grew additively
(`copy_with_progress`/`mv_with_progress`; the old `copy`/`mv` became thin wrappers calling them
with a no-op callback), so none of last cycle's 13 tests needed to change.

**Design choices made along the way:**
- **Progress granularity is per-file, not per-byte.** A callback (`&mut dyn FnMut(&Path) ->
  ControlFlow<()>`) fires once per file/directory finished. This needs no change to
  `Vfs::copy_file` (still one atomic `std::fs::copy` call) and avoids a separate counting pass
  over the tree before copying (which would double the directory-listing I/O). A large *single*
  file shows no incremental movement until it's done — logged in `ROADMAP.md`'s low-priority
  list as a follow-up requiring a streaming `Vfs::copy_file`.
- **Cancellation is the progress callback's return value**, not a separate parameter — the
  callback returns `ControlFlow::Break(())` when it observes a shared `AtomicBool` flip (set by
  `Esc`), so one closure carries both "report progress" and "should I stop" without a second
  parameter threaded through every layer.
- **Delete has no per-file progress or cancel.** `Vfs::remove_dir_all` is one opaque
  `std::fs::remove_dir_all` call with no hook to report through; rewriting it into a manual
  recursive walk (like `copy_dir`) just for progress cosmetics wasn't worth it, since deletion
  (unlinking) is normally far cheaper than copying (writing data) — the actual bottleneck
  `ROADMAP.md` names. Delete still runs on `spawn_blocking` so it doesn't freeze the UI, just
  shows an indeterminate "deleting…" status.
- **The cross-filesystem move fallback** (copy + delete when `vfs.rename` fails with
  `ErrorKind::CrossesDevices`, stabilized in Rust 1.83) was implemented this cycle as promised in
  the "Core File Operations" entry above, reusing the same `copy_with_progress` plumbing.
- **While a bulk op is running, all other actions are blocked except `Esc`** (checked before the
  keymap is even resolved) — including quit. Letting the process exit mid-write could leave a
  truncated file at the destination; the user must let the operation finish or cancel it first.
- **Rename stays fully synchronous**, calling the plain `mv` (not `mv_with_progress`) — it always
  targets the same parent directory (same filesystem, same mount), so it's an O(1) metadata
  operation with no cross-device case and nothing worth reporting progress on.
- Verified against the compiled binary (not just `cargo test`) with three scripted PTY sessions
  against a 4000-file directory: cancelling a copy after ~1 file (proving the main loop kept
  processing input while the background thread was writing), running the same copy to
  completion, and deleting the 4000-file tree via the background path.

### Shell Overlay Mechanism: Direct Stdio Inheritance, No Pty Multiplexing

**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Status:** Confirmed

#### Context / Background

The roadmap called for a "real, fully interactive `$SHELL` subprocess" via suspending the TUI —
Ranger's own shell command auto-closes after one command, which this project explicitly rejects.
The only real question was mechanism: does the child shell get a brand-new pseudo-terminal that
minuteman manages (a `portable-pty`-style approach), or does it just inherit the process's actual
stdio?

#### Decision & Rationale

Chose direct inheritance: `std::process::Command::new(shell).current_dir(cwd).status()` with
default (inherited) stdin/stdout/stderr, after the caller (`tui`) disables raw mode and leaves
the alternate screen. This works because minuteman is *already* running inside a real terminal —
raw mode is just a mode flag on that same terminal, not a separate pty layer minuteman owns.
Once raw mode is off, handing the exact same file descriptors straight to the child shell makes
it behave exactly like a normal shell session, because as far as the real terminal emulator is
concerned, it is one. A pty-multiplexing approach would only earn its keep if minuteman needed to
capture the shell's output or run something alongside it — neither applies to "get out of the
way until the user types `exit`."

**Implementation:** new `shell_overlay` crate, `pub fn spawn_shell(cwd: &Path) ->
io::Result<ExitStatus>` — reads `$SHELL` (falling back to `/bin/sh`), sets `cwd`, blocks until
exit. It does not touch raw mode/the alternate screen itself; `tui` owns that via
`TerminalGuard::suspend`/`resume`, keeping the crate boundary the same shape as `file_ops`
(does the work) vs. `tui` (owns the terminal).

**Trade-offs accepted:** the child shell has no sandboxing or capability restriction — it runs
with minuteman's own privileges, which is correct for the actual use case (a personal shell
escape, exactly like every other terminal app's `:sh`/`!`) but would need reconsidering before
any future plugin could trigger this path un-prompted.

---

### Post-Shell Redraw: `Terminal::resize`, Not `Terminal::clear`

**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Status:** Confirmed

#### Context / Background

After resuming from the shell overlay, the screen has arbitrary leftover content from whatever
the shell printed, and ratatui's internal diff buffer doesn't know that — the obvious fix is
forcing a full redraw. The first implementation called `Terminal::clear()`, which crashed the
whole app on return from the shell during PTY-based verification testing, with `crossterm`
error: "the cursor position could not be read within a normal duration."

#### Root Cause

`Terminal::clear()` (ratatui-core `terminal/buffers.rs`) calls `self.backend.get_cursor_position()`
*before* clearing, purely to restore the cursor afterward — and `get_cursor_position()`
(`ratatui-crossterm`) shells out to `crossterm::cursor::position()`, which writes a `ESC[6n`
device-status-report escape sequence and blocks reading stdin for the terminal emulator's
response. A real terminal emulator answers this instantly; the PTY-based test harness used to
verify this feature doesn't emulate that protocol, so the read timed out and `clear()` returned
`Err`, which was propagated with `?` — crashing the app immediately after the user's shell
session, the worst possible moment for a crash. This is not purely a test-harness artifact: any
real terminal/multiplexer slow to answer the DSR query (a laggy SSH session, an unusual
emulator) would hit the same failure in production.

#### Decision & Rationale

Switched to `terminal.resize(terminal.size()?.into())` — same current size, so nothing visually
moves, but `Terminal::resize` calls `clear_viewport()` internally (full `ClearType::All` +
back-buffer reset) *without* ever querying cursor position, since that's only needed by `clear()`
to restore the cursor afterward, something not worth doing right before a full redraw anyway.
`terminal.size()` itself just reads the terminal's dimensions via a `TIOCGWINSZ`-style ioctl,
which doesn't require the emulator to answer an escape code and so can't hang the same way.

**Trade-offs accepted:** `resize` is a slightly less obviously-named tool for "force a redraw"
than `clear` — worth a comment at the call site (present in `main.rs`) so a future reader doesn't
"simplify" it back to `clear()` and reintroduce the hang.

## 🧠 Usage Guidelines

Write a new entry here before committing to a major design choice (new dependency, new crate
boundary, UI library, etc.), or when revisiting/reversing a previous decision.
