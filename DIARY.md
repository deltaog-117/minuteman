### Workspace Architecture: Feature-First Cargo Workspace

**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Status:** Confirmed

#### Context / Background

Minuteman needed an initial crate/module layout before any feature code could be written.
`$SUITE/1architecture.md` mandates feature-first organization (top-level dirs named after
business capabilities, not technical layers) and a "delete test" — each feature folder must be
removable without breaking the rest of the app, with zero circular dependencies between
features.

#### Options Considered

**Option A: Single binary crate, modules by layer** (e.g. `ui/`, `fs/`, `config/`)
- Fastest to start, but violates the delete-test and layer-first rules directly; also forces one
  compile unit for the whole app, so iterating on the browser recompiles the (eventual) plugin
  host too.

**Option B: Single binary crate, modules by feature** (e.g. `browser/`, `file_ops/` as `mod`s)
- Satisfies feature-first within one crate, but Rust's visibility rules make cross-feature
  leakage easy to introduce accidentally (no hard compiler boundary), and it doesn't let heavy,
  optional dependencies (SSH, WASM plugin host) be excluded from a minimal build.

**Option C: Cargo workspace, one crate per feature** *(chosen)*
- Each feature is its own crate depending only on `shared`; Cargo itself enforces the "no
  feature depends on another feature" rule at compile time (a stray `browser -> file_ops`
  dependency simply won't compile without explicitly adding it to `Cargo.toml`, which is a
  visible, reviewable change). Optional heavy backends (`vfs_ssh`) can be dropped from the
  workspace member list without touching any other crate — a literal, mechanical delete test.

#### Decision & Rationale

Chose the Cargo workspace split: `shared` (Vfs trait + local impl, read-only infra),
`vfs_ssh`, `browser`, `file_ops`, `preview`, `shell_overlay`, `trash`, `plugins`, `theming`
(each an independent feature crate depending only on `shared`), and `tui` as the thin binary
that wires everything together via dependency injection in `main.rs`.

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- More `Cargo.toml` boilerplate than a single crate.
- Slightly slower clean-build time due to crate-boundary codegen, offset by much faster
  incremental rebuilds once more than one feature exists (changing `browser` doesn't recompile
  `plugins`).

#### Implementation Notes
- `plugins` is deliberately isolated from other feature crates (only depends on `shared`) so
  that internal refactors of `browser`/`file_ops` never force a plugin-facing API break — this
  directly serves the "stable, semver'd plugin API" differentiator from `ROADMAP.md`.
- `tui/src/main.rs` stays thin: arg parsing, config load, `Vfs`/`BrowserState` construction,
  terminal setup — no business logic.

### Config Keybinding Schema: Action-to-Keys Mapping

**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Status:** Confirmed

#### Context / Background

The user wanted config loading in place from v0.1.0 rather than hardcoded keys retrofitted
later, and asked which TOML shape to use: one key mapping to one action, or one action mapping
to a list of keys.

#### Options Considered

**Option A: key → action** (`j = "move_down"`) — simplest, but one key can only ever mean one
thing, and multi-key/leader sequences (planned for the space-leader system) don't fit the shape.

**Option B: action → [keys]** (`move_down = ["j"]`) *(chosen)* — one action can have multiple
bound keys, and the shape extends naturally to future leader sequences without a schema change.

#### Decision & Rationale

Chose B. Implemented as `RawKeyMap` (serde-deserialized, `#[serde(default)]` at both the
container and field level via a custom `Default` impl, so a partial `[keys]` table only
overrides the fields it specifies) converted into a `KeyMap` that resolves a crossterm
`KeyCode` to an `Action` via a `HashMap`. `theming` depends directly on `crossterm::event::KeyCode`
rather than inventing a separate key-representation enum — crossterm is already a hard
dependency of the application, and there's no second input backend on the roadmap that would
justify the extra abstraction layer yet.

**Trade-offs accepted:** if two keys in the config resolve to the same `KeyCode`, last-write-in
wins silently (no conflict warning) — acceptable for v0.1.0's small default keymap; worth
revisiting once user-configurable rebinding sees real use.

### v0.1.0 Local Vfs: Synchronous, No Async Runtime Yet

**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Status:** Confirmed

#### Context / Background

The project's core motivation is fixing Ranger's slow bulk file operations, which implies an
async runtime (`tokio`) somewhere. The question was whether to introduce it starting with v0.1.0
(directory listing) or defer it.

#### Decision & Rationale

Deferred. A single `read_dir` call for a miller-column pane is not a workload that benefits from
async, and pulling in `tokio` before there's an actual concurrent/long-running operation to
schedule would be unused complexity. `tokio` will be introduced when `file_ops` implements bulk
copy/move/delete with live progress reporting — the point where it earns its place.
